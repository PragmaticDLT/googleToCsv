301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,any ideas why java plugin takes so long to load?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,java 1.4?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,yes
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,java 1.5 loads _much_ faster
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,noneus: how can i get 1.5 is there a .deb somewhere?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,not yet.
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,noneus: is this blackdown or sun?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,did you install just the jre?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,I use IBM's 1.4.2
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"(jdk, because I do globus development)"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"ah ok then, i'll give it a try, does IBM have a standard jre with plugin?"
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,yes
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"thanks, i'll try that, screwed up and tried to upgrade firefox/java on my own now java takes real long time to load"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"can't seem to find an ibm jre package, would you happen to have a url?"
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,https://www6.software.ibm.com/dl/lxdk/lxdk-p
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,you have to create a login.
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,much appreciated
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,1.42 is latest IBM java?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,yes.
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,for certain arches
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,do you have j2se-common installed in ubuntu as well is ibm's java?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,I do not.
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"ok, got it"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"i don't know what's up, no matter what java plugin i use, it takes a really long time to load a java applet"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,are you using warty or hoary?  and firefox .9 or 1.0?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,Hoary (kernel from Warty) mixed with Debian Sid+experimental. mozilla-firefox 1.0-2 from Sid.
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"eh, i dare not to go there :)"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,where'd you get that mozilla-firefox from sid? ;)
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,it's in Sid's pool
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,i can get the .deb on the web?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"sure, but I'd wait a couple days. It'll probably be in Hoary within days."
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,but...Hoary...isn't that unstable?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,how did you hold back and keep Warty kernel?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"I use apt-pinning to keep the linux-* (well, kernel-related) packages pinned to warty-security"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"ok so far IBM's java is pretty clean, fast, and seems stable (so far) :D"
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,indeed.
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,so just wait a day for sed error to be fixed and don't `apt-get upgrade` at this time?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,it is already fixed. The matter of the fixed package migrating to pool is of time.
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"got it, thanks"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"LOL, CRASH! :D"
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,dell laptop?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,lsmod|grep snd_intel8x0m|wc -l
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,0 but i did install hsf deb early on then upgraded to hoary
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,and yes dell laptop sorry
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,look in /proc/interrupts and ensure an irq is being assigned to your sound chipset
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,roger
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,only thing closely resembling is i8042 would that be it?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,nope
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"ok, thanks! how to fix?"
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"and snd_intel8x0 is loaded, correct?"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,yes it is loaded
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,could be installing hsf from the get-go cause this?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,I'm not familiar w/ 'hsf'
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,hsf linuxant modem drivers
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,ah.
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"I'd try and disable anything in bios you're not using, like a printer port (since you're already using the modem)"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,dell bios is usually pretty limited but looking into now thanks
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,indeed.  you are the man.  i disabled as much as possible in bios and not soundcard is assigned an irq is it?  wonder why all of a sudden this needed to be done?  maybe because modem driver was properly installed?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"I've seen the error quite a few times with snd-intel8x0m being loaded, or an irq not being assigned, etc."
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"seems to be a problem with that bios, but I'm not certain."
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,this bios has multiple issues actually :)
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,can't get apm working with it and ubuntu and acpi support is iffy at this point
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,why is ssh only listening on tcp6?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,huh?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"sorry, netstat -tupan says ssh is listening on 'tcp6' is that ipv6 only?"
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"no, that includes IPv4"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,do you have openssh-server installed? if so can you real quick 'ssh localhost' let me know if it works? if you are running unstable...
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,it's fine.
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,on the wiki.
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,roger that :)
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,any more broken than normal? no.
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"can't get my usb mp3 player to fire up with gnomad2, it just hangs, and latest isn't in SID yet, which i need as it's a new player"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,what is the command to make a dep out of a source package?  'make dist' ?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,dep/deb
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"no, it's more complicated than that for some packages."
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,for what application are you attempting this?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,libnjb
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,there is 'debian' subdir
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,which x.org devel package?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,um there is no xorg-devel ?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,what issues?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"like if two soundcards doesn't select the right one or something, i just remember having sound issues upon initial install of warty"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"i gave my neighbor a bunch, he knows all the kids in town, and going to hand em out at school :D"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,but i think gave my neighbor too much going to take some back for school
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"i'll fire up laptop and check, one sec"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"yep, broken, sorry about that"
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,what packages did mplayer-586 [for warty]  choke on?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"libarts0, libfrididi0, libggi2, libungif4g"
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"I'm backporting it from hoary; if you're willing to try the packages, I'll let you know from where to grab them when it finishes."
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"awesome, of course :)"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,attempting the downgrade as mentioned per the wiki
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,ping
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,the downgrade seemed to work :D
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,excellent.
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"there are a few issues with gmplayer of that mplayer, /query ?"
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,have you run across any?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"yes, a few with gmplayer"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"two, actually"
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,spill.
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"(1) when gmplayer starts the rotary (hourglass) hangs for a few seconds like it's waiting for something to initialize and (2) nevermind, and issue in my mplayer.conf :) and (3) might set the default xo=xv so that when 'f' key for fullscreen, image isn't centered in middle of screen but does take up full screen?  the first is the only real issue though.  let me run gmplayer in terminal"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,ok when i start gmplayer in terminal there is no hang
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,i don't use gmplayer really but...
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,only when i start it from menu
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,I will take a look at the menu entry
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,don't understand (2) or (3)
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"x11 is a safer default, because xv is broken on some chipsets"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,nevermind on (2) and (3) x11 is safer? nevermind on that one as well :)
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,thanks for notifying.
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,xv is optimised for the drivers that support it properly
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,only probs can find then is when launched from menu entry
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,think it's safe to use hoary 2.6.10 kernel in warty?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"your call, though I advise you to stick with Warty's if you use the binary-only Nvidia or ATI driver."
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"got it, thanks"
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,did starting gmplayer from the menu work in a previous mplayer build?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,know how redhat has ntsysv ncurses based app does ubuntu/debian have anything similar for handling init scripts?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,update-rc.d
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,fscking update-rc.d fscking giving me fscking headaches
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,there must be something awry with your menu entry for gmplayer. Someone else attests that it executes perfectly.
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"you're right, sorry about that, it's probably on my end as i did an downgrade from hoary to wary, thanks, anymore testing i can do let me know, i should have mentioned that beforehand, but it works!"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,how to fix the menu entry?  anything like delete ~/.gconf or?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,know if when hoary ships fbsplash will be enabled and if so will default gnome-terminal background be the fbsplash image file?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"to be honest, I have no idea; jdub probably has a much clearer idea."
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,ok thanks
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"links, w3m, lynx, ..."
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,can you dcc me /etc/Muttrc that ships with mutt?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"hi, i've ran a few apps under 'sudo -s' now things are messed up, is there any way to recover?"
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,that depends entirely on what you commands you executed.
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"guarddog, lokkit, firestarter, i think is all"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,now ls -l doesn't respond and gnome panels are messed up and nautilus can't start
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,or is there a link to unfsck? i.e. i know it was mentioned in k3b-setup
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,what did you do with those applications?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"(I use a homebrewed iptables script, so I'm afraid I can't necessarily assist.)"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"i launched them under 'sudo -s' and configured them, or would there be another reason why ls -l /home/lance doesn't respond?"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,or gets hung?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"usually if that command doesn't respond, you have a serious problem like a kernel oops"
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,does it work after a reboot?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,sure doesn't
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"let me try booting another kernel, brb"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,it was stupid firestarter and networked filesystems
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,how's array 4 working out?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"Hoary system itself seems fine, but I can't use the display since the crt is kaput. :)"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,thanks
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"i *really* like the new update manager btw, much more intuitive and simpler than synaptic :)"
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,aptitude is another front end to apt.
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"lol i did, why? :P"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,is aptitude safer to use than say apt-get dist-upgrade?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"'safer?' for me, it's preference."
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,ever use openbox?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"for a long time, openbox2 - then openbox3 - were my preferred wms"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,using metacity now?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"no, I'm at work, so I'm technically using whatever XP uses."
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,on your ubuntu box i meant
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,for my main user - yes - although I use a variety of wms for different users
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,know how with openssh it will not write ~/.ssh/known_hosts?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,i.e. known_hosts doesn't get written when the server sends it's public key...
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"why would it when the keys are exchanged? that file is only modified when you, as the user, acknowledge affirmatively that you wish to add the host key"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,my problem is i have two computers behind the same domain name so i get a 'man in the middle attack' warning and no connect when switching between the two
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,'switching between the two?'
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"ssh to one computer name@domain different port, disconnect, ssh same_name@domain different port, the second time i  get warning and no connect"
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,the warning is normal
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"i figured it out, thanks!!!"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"hi, does ~/.gnome2 contain gconf variables?"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,muine is in universe afaik
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"it's crashing often in hoary after running mp3gain on a large mp3 dir, should i file a bug?"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,i was asking if muine is in universie
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,absolutely
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,0.8.2-5ubuntu1 is hoary/universe
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,do i need to copy anybody or defaults is good?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,defaults are fine.
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,opened a bug regarding muine
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,#?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,7124
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,is it possible muine is having a buffer overflow due to libmuine.so.so not being able to be found?  why it's looking for that i have no clue.
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,buffer overflow? highly doubtful.
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"just a wild guess, how can i provide more debugging info?  gdb tells nothing."
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,did you set the MONO_DEBUG env var to a nonzero value?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"only thing i set was MONO_LOG_LEVEL=debug, what do you recommend setting it to? like 3?"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,export MONO_DEBUG=3 should work?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,or 5 or something
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,if i go into gconf settings and change monitored folder to something else it pops back working
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,last line in debug is Mono-INFO: DllImport loading location: 'libglib-2.0.so.0'. then it segfaults.
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"could be one particular mp3 on my end, i'll try to isolate a bit more"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,isolate *it* lol
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,how's it going mate?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"n'bad, yourself?"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"not bad, just watched a smoothwall install die on a 1000mb nic card and might be getting some work installing a linux server later on"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"and *really* impressed with how ubuntu is coming along, minus the crap of a power management my laptop has"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,what should i use as cd burning app if i want to get rid of k3b?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,graveman?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,can graveman do iso's or just rely on nautilus for that?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,is there alsa cvs available in ubuntu?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,cvs? no.
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,1.0.8 is available in hoary/universe via the 'alsa-source' package.
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"yes, my card just got 24-bit support but i have to patch against cvs to use it, i can wait i guess, would be nice though :)"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,on my laptop with Hoary if i 'dmesg|grep -i dsdt' it says initrd doesn't have a dsdt patch when on bugzilla it says it does...
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,any ideas on the dsdt or just comment on the closed bug?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"sorry, could you point me to the bug #?"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3379
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"ok, will look in a bit, busy atm"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,ok thanks
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,none. alsa-driver is the name of the source package.
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,what specifically are you looking for?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,driver module
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,try using the alsa-source and alsa-base debs from experimental
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,I'm using them just fine (1.0.8+1.0.9rc2-1)
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,how can i get experimental?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,it's fairly complicated (you can't use the debs directly)
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,can i make .debs from alsa-driver package?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"yes, if you tweak."
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"however, the dependencies are fairly twisted.  I don't recommend it."
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,ok thanks
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,which contains the .ko file?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,in regular hoary
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,the alsa-driver deb that you build from alsa-source
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,linux-image contains those
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,k thnx
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,i know it's probably not a good idea but going to stick with alsa-driver stable for now self compiled p16v support in 1.0.9rc2 seem broken
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,sure.  How is ca0106 in 1.0.9rc2 broken?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,you have to use a corresponding 1.0.9rc2 libasound2 as well
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,no 24bit support for audigy2
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"ah, so i need the libs as well? doh"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,still broken it seems
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,what is?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,1.0.9rc2?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"p16v support for audigy2, eys"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,regular pcm works fine
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,and you've confirmed via cvs revisions that this is the case?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,nope. just tried rc2
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"it's not high priority really, i've submitted a big to gnome's bugzilla regarding gstreamer and custom sink to enable p16v but reckon should wait until at least it makes it into stable before following up on bug?"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,p16v support in alsa for audigy2 that is (wait until stable)
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"not sure how gst would really help there, besides being able to specify a virtual device."
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,as the custom sink is broken in gst and works in xine?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"afaik, the fact that p16v support even works in RC1 is a complete fluke, because it appears to be utterly broken"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"and broken it is in rc2 heh, i'll help jcdutton if i can"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"hi, how's it going? do you know how to load a custom dsdt in initrd?"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,in hoary...
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,why did they remove the ndiswrapper page?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"they didn't, it's having difficulties. See the topic."
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,there's no one package that does.
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,i messed it up somehow is there a way to reset?  when i run dhclient it doesn't write the nameservers
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,i was helping troubleshoot the wireless network at school and installed pump and other junk
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,how to fix my /etc/resolv.conf so that it writes nameservers when using dhclint? :(
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"you're not invoking dhclient manually, are you?"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,yes
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,i am invoking dhclient manually
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"err, why?"
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,the instance in /etc/network/interfaces doesn't work?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,what is that?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,that's the actual file.
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,ok
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,hi
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,hi
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,what to do after 'apt-get install alsa-source' to install 1.0.8 driver?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"figured it out lol, thanks to linkage"
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,weren't you using 1.0.8cvs anyhow?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,um was using emu10k1 (oss) there for a bit then to ubuntu stock now 1.0.8
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,i couldn't get it to compile with cvscompile
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,hum. I could have sworn you were using ALSA 1.0.8+cvs at one point.
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"think i tried at one point, was using 1.0.9rc1"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,it's a shame actually emu10k1(oss) is a decent driver
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,of course it's decent; that's where the ALSA driver has its roots :)
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,ah
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,why when i save something to the desktop it doesn't show up?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,in gnome?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"hi, is it normal behaviour that is i save something to the Desktop folder it doesn't show up on the desktop unless i refresh that folder in Nautilus?"
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"I suppose that depends on the backend, which depends whether dnotify or inotify is used"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,which do you use?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"I use inotify, because I'm using a pre-2.6.12"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,so any previous uses dnotify?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,Hoary's kernel does
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"odd, using gtk's file save dialogue 90% of the time if i save a file to teh Desktop it doesn't show up unless i refresh in Nautilus"
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,my hunch is that dnotify+gamin are to blame
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"oh, how to get rid of them?  this is an upgrade from Warty..."
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,you don't have any choice currently
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,can i go back to fam or is that a bad idea as well?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,is a shame i'll just have to refresh nautilus to see what's on desktop w/out killing nautilus
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,bad idea to go back
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"ok then, dangit"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"should i file a bug, upgrade to breezy, or just wait?"
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"check bugzilla, certainly, but it's a better idea to wait"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"ok, dangit"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,ping
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,pong
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"remember we were talking about setting up two soundcards?  there is person in #creative could use some help with that, if you have a minute."
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,with ALSA?
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"right now oss but maybe alsa later, could you join please?"
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"have him ping me when he's dealing with ALSA, thanks"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"got it, thanks"
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,no
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,can't install captive with it?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,"sure you can, just install build-essential, gcc-3.4, and linux-headers-$(uname -r)"
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,ok thanks
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,is captive part of ubuntu or do i need to add a repo or just install a .deb?
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,you need to compile it yourself
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,thanks
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,"i found a repo for captive, should i still install from source?"
301 - 1.tsv,AGENT,a repo may not be specifically for your Ubuntu install
301 - 1.tsv,CUSTOMER,ok i'll go with the source!
60 - 402.tsv,CUSTOMER,is it ok to add a repository that is intrepid to hardy?
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"no, absolutely not"
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"you can use a backport, if there is one, or you can try compiling the *source* package of intrepid"
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,what is it?
60 - 402.tsv,CUSTOMER,zoneminder 1.23.3
60 - 402.tsv,CUSTOMER,do you have any recommendations
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"well you think wrong, backports is for installing *newer* apps. but anyway, there doesn't seem to be a backport for zoneminder."
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"if you wait a while i'll see if i can compile the intrepid version, then give you instructions to do it."
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,leave ./configure alone please.
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"you can install the Intrepid source package without touching ./configure, just have a little patience."
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"ok, i can help you get a proper package compiled, shall i?"
60 - 402.tsv,CUSTOMER,your good i keep gettin
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list, and add this line:  deb-src http://se.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ intrepid main restricted universe multiverse"
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"save, and do 'sudo apt-get update'"
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"yes, that's fine - we'll remove that line later"
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"it's true, but it's a source repository, and we'll only get this one package from it to compile"
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,top or bottom is the same
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"that's not a source package, that's just the upstream distribution. i'm talking about a *proper* Ubuntu source package, which will get a binary .deb compiled."
60 - 402.tsv,CUSTOMER,ok ill follow your lead updating sources.list starting now
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"when you're done, create an empty directory with 'mkdir mypackage', then 'cd mypackage'"
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,tell me when you're done
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"now, 'apt-get source zoneminder'"
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"then you'll have to modify a file slightly, because it doesn't compile out of the box. do 'cd zoneminder-1.23.3', then 'nano src/zm_mpeg.cpp'"
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"now go to line 281 (to do that, hit Ctrl+W, then Ctrl+T, then type 281)"
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,uh?
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"well, it's the intrepid version"
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,no
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"Hardy version is 1.22.3-10, Intrepid version is 1.23.3-3"
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"then you didn't add the intrepid line correctly (and really, there's nothing you need to comment out)"
60 - 402.tsv,CUSTOMER,im sure you right lemme double check
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,deb-src http://se.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ intrepid main restricted universe multiverse
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,and sudo apt-get update
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"ok, do you remember the rest of the steps? (you'll have to remove the stuff that was downloaded now, first)"
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"not the *old* directory, you made a *new* one, right?"
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,do you see 'url_fclose(ofc->pb);'?
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,change it to:   url_fclose(&ofc->pb);
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,then save and exit (ctrl+x)
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"yes, that doesn't matter. just change 281"
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"yes, that's right"
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,now do 'dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc' (while you're in the directory zoneminder-1.23.3)
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"ah wait, i forgot to make you get the build dependencies"
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,first do 'sudo apt-get build-dep zoneminder'
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,then 'dpkg-build-package -b -uc'
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"yes, that's correct"
60 - 402.tsv,CUSTOMER,do you have a hardy build
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,we don't want actual binary packages to be downloaded from intrepid repositories
60 - 402.tsv,CUSTOMER,ok
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"yes, but you really shouldn't take binary packages from strangers. anyway, we're nearly done"
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"but you would have installed it from the upstream source, which can be a bad idea"
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"that would not have worked, build-dep gets the dependencies to *compile*, not the ones to run the *binary* .deb package"
60 - 402.tsv,CUSTOMER,thanks for helping i run that one command inside the zoneminder direcotry right
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"yes, 'dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc'. then if you 'cd ..', you should find a .deb package ready to be installed with gdebi or dpkg -i in that directory."
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"for your information, if there hadn't been this little difficulty with line 281, you'd just have done 'apt-get build-dep packagename ; apt-get --build source packagename', and you'd have found yourself with a working .deb immediately"
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,we had to complicate that a little because of having to edit the sourcecode
60 - 402.tsv,CUSTOMER,ya im glad b/c the old version is buggy
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,has it finished compiling? i need to go away soon
60 - 402.tsv,CUSTOMER,it is still compiling this is on a somewhat slower box
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"you can just use gdebi to install it, that will get the dependencies too"
60 - 402.tsv,AGENT,"uhm i'm sorry but i just have to go now, you may have to edit debian/zoneminder.substvars and change the dependencies..."
60 - 402.tsv,CUSTOMER,dern
60 - 166.tsv,CUSTOMER,ok
60 - 166.tsv,CUSTOMER,o ok
60 - 166.tsv,CUSTOMER,ok
60 - 166.tsv,CUSTOMER,i tied using livecd but that doenst work
60 - 166.tsv,CUSTOMER,so ima re-install it using wubi since i just uninstalled it
60 - 166.tsv,CUSTOMER,nope
60 - 166.tsv,CUSTOMER,i made the cd i mean but instead i just get a black screen
60 - 166.tsv,CUSTOMER,i hear some music like the bongos
60 - 166.tsv,CUSTOMER,after that im done
60 - 166.tsv,CUSTOMER,"ok with the live cd u mean the three options demo installition , installtion, and more about ubuntu"
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,use the person's nick that your talking to when responding so your message won't get lost in the noise.. just type the first few characters of the nick and hit TAB for easy completion.
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,you didn't use tab.. my nick got misspelled :) .. (that's a smiley face)
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,yes
60 - 166.tsv,CUSTOMER,"ok good i put the cd in and i get three otoptins which are demo and full installtion, install inside windows, and learn more"
60 - 166.tsv,CUSTOMER,which 1 to chose?
60 - 166.tsv,CUSTOMER,im still on my orignal Os windows ep
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,"you've obviously inserted the cd while still in windows.. do you want to keep windows on the computer and also have Ubuntu or would you like to wipe windows off and just have Ubuntu.. or still yet, do you want to just test Ubuntu out while in the windows environment?"
60 - 166.tsv,CUSTOMER,"im just worried if ubunto doesnt work, then im screwed right?"
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,in that case leave the cd in the drive and reboot the computer.. if the boot order goes to cd first then the live cd will boot and you can test the functionality of Ubuntu on your hardware.. being a live cd it won't touch the harddrive until you actually install.. it'll be much slower but functional.
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,if there are issues then with the live cd come back here and talk about them.. there might be answers to the issues.. when ready double click the install icon
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,ok
60 - 166.tsv,CUSTOMER,a loading screen with a organge bar going back and forth like a game of ping
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,that's good.. it might take a minute or two
60 - 166.tsv,CUSTOMER,"ok well a peachish background came up, the sound of bongos played, then the screen just went black"
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,what kind of video card do you have.?
60 - 166.tsv,CUSTOMER,before the backgroudn loaded it said something like timedout....
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,is this a newer computer?
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,on reboot you had a menu that gave you the choice of windows or ubuntu.. did you install ubuntu already with wubi?
60 - 166.tsv,CUSTOMER,"should i use wubi, get to login screen then go to terminal mode and put some commands in"
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,uninstalled what?
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,so wubi was first and you uninstalled that .. except now when you boot you still get a menu?
60 - 166.tsv,CUSTOMER,"wubi i used first, installed that no icons on destop, uninstalled using wubi once again"
60 - 166.tsv,CUSTOMER,yes i sitll get a menu
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,with the black screen displaying can you click ctrl+alt+F3 and get a different black screen with a prompt?
60 - 166.tsv,CUSTOMER,lemme try
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,when you reboot you might try to get into the bios of the machine and look at the boot order.. in fact on a dell you might be able to hit a key on boot to boot directly from the cd.. if there is that option reboot and choose that.. otherwise you'll have to look in the bios to rearrange the boot order of things so the cd is first and the harddrive is second.. then you should be able to boot dir
60 - 166.tsv,CUSTOMER,ok i will try
60 - 166.tsv,CUSTOMER,just to be certain whats the rite way to unstinall ubuntu to make sure i did it right?
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,from wubi?  I've no idea.. never used wubi
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,so you have a black screen with a prompt
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,ah good.. yep
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,then it will buzz & wurr for a bit and leave you at the standard ubuntu desktop
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,is this the live cd or the alternate cd?
60 - 166.tsv,CUSTOMER,the livecd from which i burend using the iso image
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,click install ubuntu.. it won't .. it'll just take you to the live desktop..
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,??
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,that's a new one on me.. there is a wiki or something on dell's site for linux.. you might investigate there and search for your specific dell to see what issues people are having.. I suspect that there's a piece of hardware that's hanging everything up.. My new motherboard is like that.. took me two days to find an answer.
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,np.. sorry I can't be of more help
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,well if the live cd doesn't run the chances of it working without knowing what is currently wrong now is slim.. you have to solve that issue first.
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,really.. what's the answer?
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,so the screen is working?  good .. just keep going and for space tell it to use the entire drive..
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,so he stopped you from installing or are you continuing?
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,so you're running the live cd? or back to windows? or what?
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,cool.. will your dad approve? or be pissed?
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,full install takes less space than windows.. and it has all the programs you need typically.. then you can add tons more.
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,I take it this is your machine?
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,you in college yet?
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,you're pretty adventerous.. it's a great time for you to learn linux.. I'll help you a lot in the future..
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,It's a good place to be.. I'm just an old dog learning new tricks
60 - 166.tsv,AGENT,/nick <new name>

60 - 30.tsv,CUSTOMER,hi all
60 - 30.tsv,CUSTOMER,I'm having difficulties installing 11.04 LTS 32-bit on my desktop
60 - 30.tsv,CUSTOMER,is there anyone around who can help me?
60 - 30.tsv,CUSTOMER,"well, I can get it to boot the live-cd"
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,What is the issue?
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,All on one line please.  and get to the point :)
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,I've heard about that before.  Is this machine online when the ubuntu installer is running?  (is this a liveCd or liveUSB?)
60 - 30.tsv,CUSTOMER,this machine is online
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,Can you take a screenshot of the installer in it's frozen state? and paste it on imageshack.us
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,ok
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,device sr0 is the CD
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,Many many i/o errors are very common on liveCDs
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,the freeze or the i/o errors?
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,I don't remember the installer well enough to follow.  Is it now unfrozen?
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,Just finish the install without doing anyting extra
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,Does it freeze regardless of the check boxes?
60 - 30.tsv,CUSTOMER,I'll now find out... I have tried all options except for checking NONE of the boxes
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,haha ok :)
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,does the rest of the liveCD work?
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,I mean right now.  Is the whole thing frozen or just the installer
60 - 30.tsv,CUSTOMER,I'm booting into live now... see if everything works there...
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,k
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,"good idea, burn slow (or use liveUSB, I recommend liveUSB if possible)"
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,64bit is fine
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,there are many ways: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/USB%20Installation%20Media
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick#Creating%20a%20bootable%20Ubuntu%20USB%20flash%20drive
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,Great :/
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,I suggest just downloading the ISO again (check the md5 sum) and make a liveUSB instead of liveCD. If the problem persists I can suggest some more things
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,the installer is picky lately IMO
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,yay :)
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,give it some time
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,":) great, boot that (you made a USB drive right?)"
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,yep
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,k
60 - 30.tsv,CUSTOMER,got into the graphical installer again
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,k
60 - 30.tsv,CUSTOMER,still nothing
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,frozen ?
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,open gparted
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,open gparted
60 - 30.tsv,CUSTOMER,'Failed to run /user/sbin/gparted as user root'
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,run it via the gui
60 - 30.tsv,CUSTOMER,"I did, just double-clicked it..."
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,sudo gparted in a term    ?
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,the liveCD is a full OS.  What are you talking about?
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,choose 'try ubuntu' you can install either way (it's a stupid choice)
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,Do any of the partitions have any errors? red !'s or orange triangles or similar?
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,I thought so.  Are they NTFS partitions?
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,Use windows to check all your partitions.  Something is wrong with them and it is causing hte installer to crash
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,yay
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,I don't really know the details of fixing it other than making a new partition table (GPT) may delete everything
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,:D
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,hahah :(
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,ict ?
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,check the anyway
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,:)
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,They took fixmbr out?!
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,?
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,fdisk is still in ubuntu
60 - 30.tsv,AGENT,gparted is not good at fixing ntfs partitions.  I strongly recommend you use windows to fix it
60 - 233.tsv,CUSTOMER,"I upgraded from Ubuntu 7.04 to 7.10 last night and now I can't boot up :/. I get the error 'kernel panic-not syncinc:VFS:unable to mount root fs'. Booting to the old kernel makes it to the graphical login, but hangs... I can log in through terminal. the menu.lst has the same root and kernel-'root=' setting for both the new and old kernels. How can I fix this so I can get on my computer again?"
60 - 233.tsv,CUSTOMER,do you guys think if I upgrade through the terminal login (since I can't get graphical) the problem will go away??
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,did you get any errors?
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,did you get any errors during the upgrade or experience any problems?
60 - 233.tsv,CUSTOMER,"what do you mean? Whenever I try to boot up I get 'kernel panic-not syncing:VFS:unable to mount root fs on unkown-block (0,0)' I guess that can be considered an erro etc."
60 - 233.tsv,CUSTOMER,I don't recall any errors throught the installation. I was sleeping while it updated
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,do you have initrd-tools installed on the system?
60 - 233.tsv,CUSTOMER,I don't believe I do. Not if it'd not bundled with ubuntu I don't
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,are you on the machine now?
60 - 233.tsv,CUSTOMER,"no, I'm on another computer. I've been going back and forth on it all morning haha so it's no deal. Do you need any info for it"
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,well on the broken computer try doing a dpkg-reconfigure of the linux-image-`uname -r`
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,actually scratch that you don't need to get in to that.
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,try to reinstall the kernel and update-grub
60 - 233.tsv,CUSTOMER,how do I re-install the kernel and update-grub?
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,the problem may just be with your /boot/grub/menu.1st file on the system. But with out seeing the file its hard to tell.
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,type in update-grub
60 - 233.tsv,CUSTOMER,I can tell you about my menu.lst
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,are you able to paste it?
60 - 233.tsv,CUSTOMER,"no, but I have information for it."
60 - 233.tsv,CUSTOMER,menu.lst. has the same root and kernel-'root=' setting for both the new and the old kernel
60 - 233.tsv,CUSTOMER,what exactly do you need to know about my menu.lst
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,does your menu.1st have initrd images listed under each kernel?
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,and also what is the version of the kernel you are trying to boot 2.6.????
60 - 233.tsv,CUSTOMER,is this is? '/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.20-15-generic root=UUID=739367f4-5181-48ad-82c0-e7d028c6cf44 ro quiet splash'
60 - 233.tsv,CUSTOMER,"I can log in throguh terminal using 2.6.20-15, I can get to graphical login, bot it hangs."
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,under that line should be something like initrd /boot/initrc.img-blah
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,is that there?
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,alright log in to the machine in recovery mode and run update-grub
60 - 233.tsv,CUSTOMER,sorry I was at the other machine. The old kernel (that I can get up to the graphical lagin to) has this line: 'initrd:  /boot/initrd.img-2.6.22-15 generic'
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,okay. does the new one have a similary line just with the updated version numbers of 2.6.whatever
60 - 233.tsv,CUSTOMER,but the new kernel is missing that particual line. Should I still run the grub-update?
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,yes. grub-update will try to recreate your menu.1st automatically is all.
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,after grub-update is done check the menu.1st and you will need that initrd line for the new kernel. I'm just hoping it will add it for you.
60 - 233.tsv,CUSTOMER,"ok. so just run at terminal 'grub-update'. Once that is done, do you need the new kernel initrd or should it work?"
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,yes run 'update-grub' at a terminal. Like I explained it should add the initrd line you need. but you can check yourself after it is done.
60 - 233.tsv,CUSTOMER,"that didn't add the line... do I need to upgrade maybe? I tried using another kernel, I am going to see if that works."
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,I would try adding the line myself. Just copy one of the other ones the only thing that needs to change is the version number at the ends 2.6.etc....
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,ifyou look at one of the entries that has the line its pretty self explanitory.
60 - 233.tsv,CUSTOMER,how do I add that like?
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,edit the file with nano
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,sudo nano /boot/grub/menu.lst
60 - 233.tsv,CUSTOMER,"thank you, and just add it?"
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,after you are done editing save the file by hitting ctrl+w
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,yeah just add it like the working kernels have.
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,youc an back it up first to by sudo cp /boot/grub/menu.lst /boot/grub/menu.lst~
60 - 233.tsv,CUSTOMER,"even after adding in the line, it says the file isn't found... Should I download the kernel again or..?"
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,what do you mean the file isn't found?
60 - 233.tsv,CUSTOMER,I guess the kernel didn't download properly. Do I have to re-download it?
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,did the error message change?
60 - 233.tsv,CUSTOMER,"there's no more 'problem syncing' or whatever message, but now it says that the file can't be found. I can still access the other kernel, but it still hangs at graphical login.."
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,sudo aptitude install initramfs-tools
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,then update-grub again.
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,you would have to update your /etc/apt/sources.list and change all references to gutsy then do a dist-upgrade.
60 - 233.tsv,CUSTOMER,crap really?? so that's even more things to take care of. Daaaamnnn :/
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,what do yOU mean?
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,Like I said it soundslike you are missing some packages particularly the inittramfs-tools
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,sry one t there.
60 - 233.tsv,CUSTOMER,"well I figured that if I upgraded from 7.10 to 8.04 through the terminal, that might fix the problems :/"
60 - 233.tsv,CUSTOMER,"I tried getting the initramfs-tools, but it said I gotta disable something... and I don't know exactly what it is"
60 - 233.tsv,AGENT,well you need initramfs-tools to generate the missing file.
60 - 44.tsv,CUSTOMER,"Facebook, Hotmail and yahoo mail will NOT load"
60 - 44.tsv,CUSTOMER,I left the computer on for hours and it would not load facebook at all
60 - 44.tsv,CUSTOMER,I can no longer check my mail
60 - 44.tsv,CUSTOMER,No.
60 - 44.tsv,CUSTOMER,Its not the internet
60 - 44.tsv,CUSTOMER,its ubuntu
60 - 44.tsv,CUSTOMER,windows xp works fine
60 - 44.tsv,CUSTOMER,and vista
60 - 44.tsv,CUSTOMER,both load everything
60 - 44.tsv,CUSTOMER,Its has to have something to do with ubuntu being windows xp and vista both load hotmail facebook and yahoo mail
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,is ubuntu detecting your network? (wireless?)
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,is it not loading just those sites?
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,that is unusual
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,installed the latest X? as in an update or manually installed from another source?
60 - 44.tsv,CUSTOMER, The Lastest X made my OS stable without it my computer was crashing into the log in hence logging me out
60 - 44.tsv,CUSTOMER, Manually installed with multi lines using &&
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,i don't know how X would affect the ability to use hotmail etc (it shouldn't make a difference)
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,what prblems were you having with X that is on 10.10 default?
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,what graphics card do you have?
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,"well i'm stumped, if it was a graphics problem it would have pushed you to the cli, but you are able to get so far as to try to open a program then it crashes"
60 - 44.tsv,CUSTOMER," All I know is without the lastest X I'm screwed but, before I installed it firefox worked on every site"
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,have you tried giving ubuntu+1 a go (11.04)
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,at least you can tell if your graphics will work in the next release
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,"i think so, but i'm trying to ascertain whether the X in 11.04 has been updated so that you don't run into the problem with the new release"
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,one sec
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,thats the alpha2: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/natty/alpha-2/
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,i came across this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1603534
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,"i'm not suggesting you switch to it, i just want to make sure the X in 11.04 will work for you"
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,you need to copy it with root authority
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,hang on
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,sudo cp /path/to/file /path/to/copyto
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,not sure if i got that command right
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,where have you got the xorg.cong file now?
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,sudo cp /home/zombie/Desktop/xorg.conf /etc/X11
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,open a file manager and look in /etc/X11 is xorg.conf there?
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,restart
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,"sorry, i just realized that you're running an updated X, that was meant to be done on the default 10.10 X"
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,you can delete the xorg.conf and it will return back to normal
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,then another restart
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,"welcome back, sorry about all that"
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,do you have anything important on ubuntu?
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,i'd recommend that you reinstall ubuntu 10.10 and see if you can get a fix for the Xorg crashes
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,"there has to be a reason why X is crashing on 10.10, if you can find out why maybe it can be fixed (seems like we are swapping one problem for another)"
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,welcome back
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,"seems like it, though still don't know how or why"
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,but wine and zsnes crashes?
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,i think it was just half an hour
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,time flys when you're having fun :)
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,what do you use in wine (might be overkill but you could try virtualbox and a windows vm as an alternative)
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,not sure what you mean by the updates messing with you?
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,sounds rather vague
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,"updates have always been rock solid for me, not sure what happened when you manually installed the new X last time but it must have messed something up"
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,"i've always been a laptop guy myself, thinkpads have always worked great with ubuntu"
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,yup
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,did you see what was getting updated?
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,hmm
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,i must confess i'v never used apt-get from command line (more of a pacman guy myself)
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,"i have to admt, i don't do anything when updating (to make sure the updates run smoothly)"
60 - 44.tsv,AGENT,i don't recommend that
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,How do i forward ports for my deluge torrent client ??????????????????
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,"that usually depends on your rounter, not your os"
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,?
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,"in xp, i got proper portforwarding without configuring any. but here it always says 'no incoming connections'"
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,"there are ways computers get around router port forwarding, such as upnp, but port forwarding will definitely work in ubuntu"
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,"google search for deluge port forwarding, and you'll probably find a good guide"
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,ok..
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,"don't worry, it's usually pretty easy!"
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,i like deluge more than transmission... deluge has good gui :P
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,"heh, transmission is my favorite, but I haven't tried deluge yet."
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,mm! ok
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,do you know a way to check whether port is forwarded or not ??
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,sometimes bittorrent clients will let you do that in the preferences... otherwise I saw a connection-checker-torrent on the internet a while back -- you could try searching for that
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,"to actually set up port forwarding you need to log into your router, and that's what you'd need a guide for"
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,i entered my ip address in firefox. it asked for password and username.. i entered both.. then a page appeared.. but it had no word called 'port forward' :(
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,it's labeled differently for many rounters.. I think mine was under security settings or something
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,i dont have a static ip.. so it will come ?
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,a DSL router i have from nokia siemens
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,"sorry, what about a static ip?"
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,"but i saw a similar in portforward.com ... but the screenshot there has some options underwhich one can find portforwarding.......... for my, it is not showing that at all.. i have checked all in that page.."
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,"hmm, try looking under all the preferences/settings for port forwarding. It should be there somewhere"
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,no matter what number i set.. transmission preferences windows shows 'port CLOSED' only ..   transmission cannot open ports by itself :P :P ??
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,"yes, that's right. You have to open the port from your router, and then put that port number into transmission"
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,you said you have a nokia siemens router?
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,True
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,but it doesnt match with the one in portforward.com
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,could you find the model number on it? Different models will probably have different settings
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,is model number = mac number ??
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,"no. mac number has to do with your network. your router should have the model number written on it somewhere, like nokia 1600 or something"
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,Nokia siemens networks. . .. residential router 1600 ......... rat8hg 12vdc  700 MA .............
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,yes yes yes. it is .. residential router 1600
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,ok -- can you search for port forwarding for that specific router model?
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,ok.
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,thankyou for guiding.!
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,no problem -- did you get it working?
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,no. but i'll .. later  /thanks
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,alright. good luck!
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,Dr_Willis : the alternate cd _can_ be used to upgrade -- just make sure you download the correct one for your system
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,ok.. before giving my frnd alternate 9.10.iso. i should give him all updates till date in 9.04.. right ?
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,or is this step not needed ?
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,"it's recommened, but I'm not sure if it's actually needed. That's a very good question to ask this channel!"
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,"even my update manager has 300+ mb of updates.. but its not updating.... after entering password.. it says 'fix broken first' and in synaptic , it shows no broken packages to fix... now what say ?"
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,try checking with the commandline: open terminal and type 'sudo apt-get install -f' without the quotes
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,"0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 1343 not upgraded."
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,did you already start upgrading to 9.10?
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,-- you shouldn't have that many packages waiting to be upgraded... I don't know why that happened
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,i always install updates daily
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,"but now, it says 380 mb to be updated... i enter your command and also entered autoremove command... but still update manager says 'fix broken first' but i have no broken in synaptic"
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,could you check something for me? 'less /etc/apt/sources.lst' and see if they say 'jaunty'
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,hey. that command told 'no such file or directory'
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,sorry! it should be 'less /etc/apt/sources.list'
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,this is the file that tells apt-get what upgrades to download
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,http://paste.ubuntu.com/305895/ here go
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,yeah they say karmic
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,which means it thinks it's upgrading already
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,try opening the file in nano and changing every instance of 'karmic' back to 'jaunty'
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,then run sudo apt-get update
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER," oh! ok,."
60 - 286.tsv,AGENT,"sorry, but I have to go. Good luck with everything!"
60 - 286.tsv,CUSTOMER,thanks.. thats helped me to fix.
60 - 82.tsv,CUSTOMER,omg
60 - 82.tsv,CUSTOMER,"why is yum insisting on pulling in adobe reader, when i only need flash"
60 - 82.tsv,CUSTOMER,>_<
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,"this is ubuntu support, not redhat/fedora"
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,"ok, please try to keep that noise out of the channel"
60 - 82.tsv,CUSTOMER,"he won't, even he uses the rpm command instead of yum"
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,he won't what ?
60 - 82.tsv,CUSTOMER,"using an rpm command to remove a previous kernel will clean up the grub automatically, as opposed to yum, which will not. the ubuntu portion of grub will also be preserved"
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,fedora will not update ubuntus grub config
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,which is what I said
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,no - it won't then
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,"as ubuntu now uses grub2 which is manged from /etc from within ubuntus install, not /boot any more"
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,hence why I'm saying it's not a real headache
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,from where ?
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,then they are not experimental
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,doesn't look like it
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,what part of 'stop talking about fedora' am I not making cleaer to you ?
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,there are a few bugs logged for it that are being worked on
60 - 82.tsv,CUSTOMER,ok. this is a pretty big problem
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,I'm well aware
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,xorg is part of the alternative install
60 - 82.tsv,CUSTOMER,xorg is not installed by default when you install a command line system
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,xorg is installed by default from the alternative cd
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,how do you install a command line system from the alternative cD ?
60 - 82.tsv,CUSTOMER,press f4 at boot prompts
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,"super, thank you"
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,why does the colour matter ?
60 - 82.tsv,CUSTOMER,latter models are supposedly more susceptable
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,to what ?
60 - 82.tsv,CUSTOMER,why?
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,why what ?
60 - 82.tsv,CUSTOMER,why do swap partitions lack a uuid
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,"I'm not %100 certain why, possibly because there is no file system to create a checksum size on"
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,please don't miss-lead people
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,STOP
60 - 82.tsv,CUSTOMER,of course
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,"you don't have to re-install and you should not re-install every 6 months, that is not a method of stopping defragging"
60 - 82.tsv,CUSTOMER,"i reinstall, for clean disk."
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,yes 'you' re-install
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,why are you asking in #ubuntu ?
60 - 82.tsv,CUSTOMER,off-topic?
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,nonsense
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,no it's not
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,macs are supported and have been for a long time
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,"that's nothing to do with ubuntu, as you no"
60 - 82.tsv,CUSTOMER,ubuntu is based on debian? ok
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,so ? it's nothing to do with ubuntu
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,no
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,because it's not stable enough
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,"do some research on it, it's currently broke, but it's stability changes up and down daily"
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,but that is listed on the https://help.ubuntu.com guide which you should have read before installing
60 - 82.tsv,CUSTOMER,do you use 64-bit ubuntu?
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,yes
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,just ask the question
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,"it's not great, but it's also not the end of the world"
60 - 82.tsv,CUSTOMER,it happens because the tmp directory is a tmpfs
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,"ok, doesn't change what I said though"
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,no
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,11.04 can be discussed in #ubuntu+1
60 - 82.tsv,AGENT,no
60 - 278.tsv,CUSTOMER,anyone know how to fix overlapping partitions?
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,sort the spacing/sizing out
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,sorting the space out so partiitons don't over lap
60 - 278.tsv,CUSTOMER,how do you do that without using gparted
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,what tool are you using
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,you've asked like 100 times - just wait a minute
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,there are other people wnating help
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,"it doesn't work like that, if you have overlapping partitions your paritions table is screwed"
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,deleting the mandrivva parition won't fix that
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,if your partition table/data is messed up
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,if your partition table is dead - you'll have to rebuild your disk system
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,its mounted read only
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,"I've told you about 4 times, if your partition tables are overlappying your data is worthless, so you'll have to rebuild"
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,"if its mounting it read only and fsck won't fix it, that suggests there is a fatal problem"
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,I'm not confused
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,your tyring to access your data and copy data around on /media that you've just mouonted a disk on
60 - 278.tsv,CUSTOMER,is confused
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,I assure you I'm not
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,I didn't say they where not
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,if your partitions are overlapping there is a good probabilyt of file system corruption
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,"you /think/ you can access the data, that doesn't mean its all there and ok"
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,your encoder / card does hd - not the software
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,create a theme
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,"create a theme, in that theme define your icon set"
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,sure
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,create an icon pack
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,or edit the current one
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,/usr/share/themes (from memory - not certain)
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,/usr/share/icons then there is .theme files somewhere
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,/usr/share/icons for system wide ones (as I've said 2 times
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,the ~/.icons are you personal ones
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,"look for the .theme files, there is also a sub forum on ubuntuforums.org for art work which may have guides for you"
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,"I'm no icon master, have a glance through the forum and look for the guides I suggested"
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,there is a whole artwork (which covers icons) sub forum on ubuntuforums.org
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,did you look in the forum ?/
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,did you not find any threads on modifying themes ?
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,what video card
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,are you using the restricted drivers channel
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,have you reconfigued it to the correct resolution ?
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg ?
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,what resolution are you trying for
60 - 278.tsv,CUSTOMER,1440 x 900
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,ok - so did you select JUST that resoution when you did the reconfigured
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,and what resolution do you get
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,apt-get remove gnome-desktop
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,I hope you have something else already installed
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,use synaptic to remove it all
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,"it will remove EVERYTHING as gnome apps depend on gnome, so if you remove gnome - the apps won't work"
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,use synaptic and click what you want gone and hit remove all
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,"depends on dependencies, but yes as I've said, open synmaptic and remove all gnome apps"
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,"yes, but you have to call out the packages"
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,no - use synaptic or apt-cache to search for the correct package names
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,there will be a LOT
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,to remove the package you need to know the correct package name
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,"so you'll need to use synaptic to search and select for the packages, or apt-cache to search for the packages then apt-get remove to remove them"
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,remove ubuntu-desktop
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,or whatever the correct gnome package name is
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,thats why I said 'search'
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,that won't remove everything due to dependencies
60 - 278.tsv,AGENT,thats not it
