NAT means that vmware machines will share your computer's connection,what is NAT networking?? (the other thing worked now THX ),"when you setup a virtual machine, you have to choose how it is conencted. I always use MA","ok, good",now it seems to have run the entire installer without problems :D,NAT,no problem,thx alot,nm i think i figured this one out myself,what now??

246.tsv,II backed up a file... renamed it but I cant remember why i did this.... heres the contents.... does anyone recognize what this is....127.0.0.1 localhost,::1 ip6-localhost ip6-loopback myservername.com,# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts,ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix,fe00::0 ip6-localnet,ff02::2 ip6-allrouters,ff02::1 ip6-allnodes,"bad bad bad, pasting like that.  /etc/hosts",ff02::3 ip6-allhosts,thanx,i changed the name of everything i just posted,hehehe,np. Use a better backup naming convention next time ;p,"it's essential for system operation, it defines the basic network addresses for the machine.     127.0.0.1  localhost   <newline>  127.0.1.1 <hostname>   are the two absolutely critical lines",what is etc/hosts goos for? my backup is different then whats in here,the 192.xx.xx.xx <names> you had are optional,changing this in 'Manual Network Conf' in the top-right corner of the screen is that same thing??,so whe would one want to alter this file?,"no. That's something different, used for addressing outside the machine.",ok.  at this point my current file only has a local host,"if you don't have those two lines, gnome and sudo are not going to work properly.   It can also be used to identify machines on your local network so you can address them by name, not just by ip number.",so would the same work in revierse... if i put my machine in there.... would another machine be able to access it by SSH (BTW i have SSH installed),"say for example you have a machine on your network named james, with the fixed ip of 192.168.0.144 . If you put the line  192.168.0.144  james in that file, you can do ssh me@james instead of ssh me@192.168.0.144",so at this point theres really no reason to alter it for SSH or any file sharing?,"if that machine has a correspoding entry for your machine and it's ip address in it's own /etc/hosts.   That file is the really old school networking system, before dns",I have OSX and windows boxes on it,"if you have no other machines on your network, no",thanks so much for the info,"the osx box may have an /etc/hosts file, but I'm not familiar with bsd variants. Windows I have no freaking clue how it works",I have 4gb of RAM,i never put swap on my machine.... should i bother with it?,whats hib. good for?,"if you have lots of memory, no real point, unless you intend to hibernate. hibernation uses the swap partition by default","if you have some apps open, want to shut down but when you turn the machine on have it return to the state it was when you turned it off",if im going to run the box remotely woudl i use hibernation?,so whats a good swap to put on then.... 1 gb max?,"useful for desktops, remote you'd have to decide.","I started with 1gb swap with 1gb mem, but the swap was too small to hibernate on according the the syslog. I increased to 2gb",4gb,i can do 2gb... i cant see me needing more than that,"up to 2gb, 8gig swap would be insane :)","jburd could have a point. I'm running 2gig now, and I can still hibernate in 2g swap though",prolly wont even use it,don't see a reason for hibernate on a server,im running UB 7.10 server,mac has it where you automatically open a app on startup but it deosnt start where you left off,"nope, you got it","different situation, that's restarting the app. hibernate (and sleep) save the state of the app, and return it to that point without restarting the app",never really liked the way that functioned either.... just another thing slowing up startup,yes.,"if i go to hib. now and try to startup i should see if it has problems, right?",i just tried hib..... now i have to wake the giant!,"but I can promise you if you have no swap, you have no hibernate",the /var/log/syslog :),gave me en error message when i logged back in.... Sleep Problem... Your comp. field to hib. Chekc the...,thanx... to give it swap i have to reinstall right.... thank you so much,"so you're on the right track now. I need to go, but I'm around most days.",peace,"not necessarily, you can use gparted to resize a partition, maybe.
